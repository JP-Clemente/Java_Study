Basic program I made while learning some NetBeans stuff. It converts given temperature in Celsius to other unities (Fahrenheit and Kelvin).


> To use, just give the Celsius starting temperature, then the variation, and finally, the maximum degree value, also in Celsius, it is very simple.
> Executable is inside the dist folder, called MatrixTemp.jar.
> Entire project is disponible.
> Made by me, Jo√£o Pedro Clemente Borges.
